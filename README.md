Unraveling the World of Rock Paper Scissors (RPS)

Rock Paper Scissors, commonly abbreviated as RPS, goes beyond the simple interactions of scissors cutting paper, paper covering rock, and rock crushing scissors. This globally cherished game transcends gender, age, athletic ability, and other distinctions, leveling the playing field for everyone. RPS is the go-to solution for settling disputes, determining who gets the last pizza slice, or assigning dish duty.

A Brief History of Rock Paper Scissors

The origins of Rock Paper Scissors can be traced back to China, where it was known as “shoushiling,” and later spread to Japan as “janken.” Over time, RPS has evolved and become a widely recognized game played by people all around the world.
